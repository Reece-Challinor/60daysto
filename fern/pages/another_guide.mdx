Front Matter / Intro
This file guides you through Days 1–10 of the 60-day AWS Developer Associate journey. During these 10 days, you’ll get comfortable with the AWS CLI, IAM configurations, EC2 basics, and the AWS SDK (Boto3). Think of these first steps as establishing your foundation: by Day 10, you’ll have a working EC2 instance secured by IAM roles and policies, and the ability to interact with AWS services via both command line and code.

Suggested Setup:

    Have this Markdown file open on one side of your screen.
    Have your terminal/console open on the other side.
    As you progress, run the commands, review the outputs, and take notes.
    Consider recording short screen captures (GIFs or videos) of key steps for your reference.

Day 1: AWS Overview and CLI Setup

Objective: Understand AWS global architecture and configure your AWS CLI.
Key Concepts: [Skill] AWS Basics, [Service] IAM, [Service] AWS CLI
Actions: Install and configure the AWS CLI, verify credentials.

Steps:

    Install the AWS CLI (if not already installed):

pip install awscli --upgrade

Configure your CLI with your Access Key and Secret Key:

aws configure

Provide region (e.g., us-east-1) and output format (e.g., json).

Validate:

    aws sts get-caller-identity

What We’re Learning:

    How AWS CLI credentials are set and how your user identity is recognized.
    This sets the stage for all other CLI-based tasks.

Day 2: IAM Users, Groups, and Policies

Objective: Create an IAM user and apply least privilege principles.
Key Concepts: [Skill] IAM Fundamentals, [Service] IAM
Actions: Create an IAM user, attach a policy.

Steps:

    Create a basic IAM policy JSON (templates/iam_policy.json) with read-only access to S3:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

Create and attach the policy to a new user group:

aws iam create-policy --policy-name MyReadOnlyPolicy --policy-document file://templates/iam_policy.json
aws iam create-group --group-name DevGroup
aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name DevGroup --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:policy/MyReadOnlyPolicy

Create an IAM user and add it to DevGroup:

    aws iam create-user --user-name DevUser
    aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name DevUser --group-name DevGroup

What We’re Learning:

    The building blocks of IAM security: users, groups, and policies.
    This sets the stage for controlling who can do what in your AWS environment.

Day 3: IAM Roles and EC2 Instance Profiles

Objective: Create an IAM role for EC2 to interact with S3 without embedding credentials.
Key Concepts: [Skill] IAM Roles, [Service] IAM, [Service] EC2
Actions: Create a role that allows EC2 to list S3 buckets, attach it via an instance profile.

Steps:

    Create a trust policy for EC2 (templates/ec2_trust_policy.json):

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com" },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

Create the role:

aws iam create-role --role-name EC2S3Role --assume-role-policy-document file://templates/ec2_trust_policy.json

Attach the read-only S3 policy (created on Day 2) to this role:

aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name EC2S3Role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:policy/MyReadOnlyPolicy

Create an instance profile and add the role to it:

    aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EC2InstanceProfile
    aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EC2InstanceProfile --role-name EC2S3Role

What We’re Learning:

    Roles vs. users: roles are “identities” that AWS services (like EC2) assume, enabling them to call AWS APIs without permanent credentials.
    This sets the stage for secure, credential-free access from EC2.

Day 4: AWS CLI Deep Dive and Filtering Output

Objective: Learn to use --query, --output flags, and named profiles for multi-account work.
Key Concepts: [Skill] CLI Mastery, [Service] AWS CLI
Actions: Filter and format CLI output for better readability.

Steps:

    List all IAM users in a table format:

aws iam list-users --query 'Users[].UserName' --output table

Create a named profile in ~/.aws/credentials (open the file and add):

[dev-profile]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region = us-east-1

Use the profile:

    aws sts get-caller-identity --profile dev-profile

What We’re Learning:

    Output formatting and querying output with JMESPath.
    Managing multiple AWS accounts or roles easily.

Day 5: AWS SDK (Boto3) Introduction

Objective: Use Python and Boto3 to interact with AWS.
Key Concepts: [Skill] SDK Usage, [Service] S3
Actions: List S3 buckets via Python code.

Steps:

    Ensure Boto3 is installed:

pip install boto3

Create a Python script scripts/list_s3_buckets.py:

import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
response = s3.list_buckets()
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(bucket['Name'])

Run the script:

    python scripts/list_s3_buckets.py

What We’re Learning:

    Programmatic access to AWS: crucial for real-world dev tasks.
    Use Python code to automate tasks.

Day 6: Temporary Credentials and STS

Objective: Understand temporary creds using STS and assume-role.
Key Concepts: [Skill] Security, [Service] STS
Actions: Obtain temporary credentials from a role and use them.

Steps:

    Assume the EC2 role we created (to simulate what an EC2 instance would get):

    aws sts assume-role \
    --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/EC2S3Role \
    --role-session-name TempSession

    Note the temporary credentials in the output.

    Export them as environment variables and try listing S3 buckets again with these temporary credentials.

What We’re Learning:

    Temporary creds improve security: short-lived and automatically expire.

Day 7: VPC Basics for Developers

Objective: Understand the default VPC, subnets, and security groups.
Key Concepts: [Skill] Networking Basics, [Service] VPC
Actions: Inspect default VPC, create a security group.

Steps:

    Describe your default VPC:

aws ec2 describe-vpcs

Create a security group:

aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name MyAppSG --description "Security Group for MyApp"

Add an inbound rule (e.g., SSH from your IP):

    aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
      --group-name MyAppSG \
      --protocol tcp \
      --port 22 \
      --cidr YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/32

What We’re Learning:

    Networking fundamentals that developers must understand for deploying services.

Day 8: EC2 Basics

Objective: Launch and connect to an EC2 instance (using the IAM role we prepared).
Key Concepts: [Service] EC2, [Action] Launch EC2
Actions: Launch an EC2 instance and assign an instance profile.

Steps:

    Create a key pair for SSH:

aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name MyKeyPair --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > MyKeyPair.pem
chmod 400 MyKeyPair.pem

Launch an EC2 instance (using the instance profile and SG):

INSTANCE_ID=$(aws ec2 run-instances \
--image-id ami-<REPLACE_WITH_AMI> \
--count 1 \
--instance-type t2.micro \
--iam-instance-profile Name=EC2InstanceProfile \
--security-groups MyAppSG \
--key-name MyKeyPair \
--query 'Instances[0].InstanceId' \
--output text)

Wait for the instance to run and then SSH in:

    aws ec2 wait instance-status-ok --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID
    PUBLIC_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].PublicIpAddress' --output text)
    ssh -i MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@$PUBLIC_IP

What We’re Learning:

    How to spin up compute resources and connect securely.

Day 9: EC2 Metadata and Permissions

Objective: Explore the instance metadata service and verify IAM role access.
Key Concepts: [Skill] Instance Metadata, [Action] Retrieve Metadata
Actions: From the EC2 instance, retrieve instance metadata and list S3 buckets.

Steps:

    On the EC2 instance:

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

Check you can list S3 buckets without credentials (role-based access):

    aws s3 ls

What We’re Learning:

    How instance metadata provides info about the running instance.
    Confirming the IAM role works as expected from the instance.

Day 10: Review and Organizing the Project

Objective: Consolidate what you’ve learned and ensure everything is organized for the next phase.
Key Concepts: [Skill] Organization, [Skill] Review
Actions: Review IAM, EC2, CLI, and SDK fundamentals.

Steps:

    Review your days01-10.md file and notes.
    Consider recording a short video clip or GIF summarizing your environment:
        Show IAM console: listing your user, role, and group.
        Show EC2 instance running.
        Demonstrate aws s3 ls from the instance without embedding keys.

What We’re Learning:

    Reflecting solidifies understanding.
    Ensuring everything is well-structured sets a strong foundation for Days 11–20 and beyond.
